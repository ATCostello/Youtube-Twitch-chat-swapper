# Youtube-Twitch-chat-swapper
Swap YouTube chat with Twitch chat and save preferences per channel.

An addon to allow automatic switching between YouTube live chat and Twitch chat specifically meant to enhance the experience when watching streamers that multi-stream!

Includes automatic config, storage of settings per channel and a quick switch between platforms.
Built for personal use as an automatic way to get the video quality of YouTube streams, but the interactivity of Twitch chat.

Supports dark mode!

On initial load of the twitch chat, the channel is automatically guessed from the YouTube channel's name. Sometimes a streamer has a different name on each platform, or the wrong name is grabbed. In this instance, please use the override text box and button to set the correct Twitch username.

The twitch chat will use your settings from the official twitch website. So make sure you're signed in to Twitch.

Install and head to a YouTube stream to see the changes.

Inspired by the incredible Twitch Chat on YouTube by Josh Houghton. All code used is my own work, but without Josh's work - I wouldn't have started development on my extension.

For Chromium browsers:
I refuse to pay to upload my extension on the Chrome store, so for now, you will need to manually download and install the extension from this repo by using the .crx file or loading the zip as an unpacked extension.
